Version: Oracle Idenity Manager 11g R2
Jar file is complied using Java 6.
A graphical user interface utility for Oracle Identity Manager
to speed up configurations for an Identity Connector Framework (ICF) connector.
The utility allows user to setup lookups, process form fields, process tasks (Only for Update),
reconciliation fields, and reconciliation mappings. Data is read from flat file and pushed to OIM.

Features Not Supported Yet
  - There is no logging framework in use. Currently, the logs are printed to standard out.  
  - Child Tables or MultiValued attributes not allowed
  - Trusted reconciliation mappings on Process Definition.

Need to Fix
  - Add checks not to remove required fields. 
  - Adding to an empty process form causes errors (Utility requires at least one form field).

==========================
 Running the Application
==========================
To run the application, go to the dist folder and type the following command:
java -jar OIMResourceAttributeUtility.jar

If you are using SSL for running the application, you must ensure the following steps are meet:

1. Ensure SSL listen Port for OIM is enabled.
Log into WebLogic Administration console.
Navigate to Servers -> OIM_SERVER.
Check mark SSL Listen Port Enabled and restart OIM server.
 
2. The following jvm argument must be specified when executing this application:
-Dweblogic.security.SSL.trustedCAKeyStore={Demo Trust Keystore}
 
In WebLogic Administration console, navigate to Servers -> OIM_SERVER -> 
Keystores to see the location of your Demo Trust Keystore. 

3. Application execution example
java -jar -Dweblogic.security.SSL.trustedCAKeyStore=/home/oracle/Oracle/Middleware/wlserver_10.3/server/lib/DemoTrust.jks OIMResourceAttributeUtility.jar

==================
 Utility Options
==================
Before running any of the utilities in this application, backup the following
artifacts using Deployment Manager:

- Process Forms
- Lookups
- Process Definition
- Resource

Use this application in conjunction with design console. The export data features 
implemented in this application is by no means a way of backing up data. Sample file
data, which can be found in sample-data directory of this project, is given for each utility.



**Lookup Utility**
This utility can add or remove entries from any existing lookup. Each record in file must be separated by a newline. 

Parameter       Description                     Sample Value
Lookup Name     The code name of a lookup       Lookup.FF.UM.ProvAttrMap
File Name       File to output to or read from

For adding new entries, the file format header is assumed to be "{CODEKEY}{DELIMITER}{DECODE}" (E.g ReturnValue;__UID__).
For removing entries, only specify the code key name. No delimiter needed.



**Process Form Field Utility**
This utility can add or remove form fields from the process form. The latest process form version
that is not active yet is modified. Each record in file must be separated by a newline.
Since this utility uses the API, the UD attribute column name is determined by the field label. 
Only through design console, you are able to name the column whatever you like when adding.
You must manually remove the "required" property on a process form field in order to delete the field.

Parameter       Description                     Sample Value
Table Name      Process form table name         UD_FLAT_FIL
File Name       File to output to or read from

For adding process form fields, the first line must be the attribute header.
Header example: field_label;variant_type;field_type;length;order;default_value;application_profile;encrypted

Header Name                 Description  
field_label                 Field Label on process form. Column name is named based on this attribute. Space are converted to underscore.
variant_type                Byte, Double, Integer, String, Short, Long, Date, Boolean, Byte Array
field_type                  TextField, RadioButton, DateFieldDlg, DOField, PasswordField, CheckBox, ComboBox, TextArea, ITResourceLookupField, LookupField
length                      Size of attribute
order                       Ordering of attribute on process form
default_value               Default value of process form field
application_profile         0 for false; 1 for true
encrypted                   0 for false; 1 for true

Record example: Email;String;TextField;45;4;;0;0

For removing process form fields, only specify the field label name.



**Process Tasks**
This utility only creates Updated process tasks that uses ICProvisioningManager.updateAttributeValue(String, String)
for a Java task. It sets up the adapter, adapter variable mapping, response code, and
process task properties. Directly modifies the metadata.

Parameter                       Description                     Sample Value
Process Definition Name         Name of process definition      Flat File
Adapter Name                    Name of process adapter         adpFFUpdateUser
File Name                       File read from

For adding Updated process tasks, the following header must be defined with exact ordering:
attrFieldName;itResourceFieldName;objectType

Header Name             Description
attrFieldName           Field label name of process form field
itResourceFieldName     Column name of the Server process form field (ITResourceLookupField)
objectType              Literal Value = User

Example: Address;UD_FLAT_FIL_SERVER;User


**Reconciliation Fields**
This utility creates or removes reconciliation fields in a given resource object.
Directly modifies the metadata. MultiValued fields are not supported by this utility.
If a recon field is marked required, you must uncheck that property in order to remove it using this utility.

Parameter                       Description                     Sample Value
Resource Object Name            Name of resource object         FLATFILERESOURCE
File Name                       File read from

For adding reconciliation fields, the first line must be the attribute header.
Example: ReconFieldName;FieldType;isRequired

Header Name             Description
ReconFieldName          Name of the reconciliation field
FieldType               Field type of reconciliation field. String, Number, IT Resource, Date
isRequired              Determine if reconciliation field is required

For removing reconciliation fields, only specified the name of the recon field each line.



**Reconciliation Mapping Utility**
This utility maps/unmaps a process form field to/from a reconciliation field. The reconciliation mappings
are defined in Process Definition of a connector. MultiValued and special OIM fields mappings (E.g. OIM_OBJECT_STATUS) are not supported.
Trusted reconciliation mappings (Mapping of reconciliation field to OIM User Profile attributes) on Process Definition are not supported.
Each record in file must be separated by a newline. Make sure your latest process form version has been activated.

Parameter                       Description                     Sample Value
Process Definition Name         Name of process definition      Flat File
File Name                       File read from

For adding new recon mappings, the file format header must be defined on the first line.
Header example: recon_field_name;form_field_column_name;is_key_field;is_case_insensitive
The following is a description of each required header attribute:

Header Name                 Description  
recon_field                 Name of the reconciliation field on resource object     
form_field_column_name      The UD attribute column name on the process form.
is_key_field                Determines if mapping will be part of the process matching during reconciliation
                            0 for false; 1 for true
is_case_insensitive         Determines if mapping will be case insensitive
                            0 for false; 1 for true

Each record in file must have a value for all header attributes.
Record example: AccountId;UD_FLAT_FIL_ACCOUNTID;1;0

For removing recon mappings, only the reconciliation field name needs to specified in the file.
